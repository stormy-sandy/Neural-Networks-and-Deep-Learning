# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
In this course, I learnt the foundations of deep learning. When I finished this class, I:
- Understood the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- was able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Knew how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 

This course also taught me how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions.
